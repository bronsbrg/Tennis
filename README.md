# Udacity Project 3: Collaboration and Competition (Tennis)

### Introduction

This project requires the [Tennis](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#tennis) environment.

![Trained Agent][image1]

In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1. If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01. Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

The observation space consists of eight variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own, local observation consisting of 24 values because the 8-element value tuple is stacked for three frames. Two continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically,

- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores.
- This yields a single **score** for each episode.

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those **scores** is at least +0.5. However, to add a slight buffer, this repo is set up to require at least +0.6.

### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below. You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86_64.zip)

    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the "headless" version of the environment.  You will **not** be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent.  (_To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to [enable a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above._)

2. Place the file in the cloned folder of this repository, and unzip (or decompress) the file. The code currently expects the executable at `./Tennis_Windows_x86_64/Tennis.exe`.

### Instructions

After completing the Dependencies below, follow the instructions in `Tennis.ipynb` to get started with training the agent!

## Dependencies

To set up your python environment to run the code in this repository, follow the instructions below.

1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__:
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	source activate drlnd
	```
	- __Windows__:
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	activate drlnd
	```

2. If running in **Windows**, ensure you have the "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019" installed from this [site](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).  This [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-install-openai-gym-in-a-windows-environment-338969e24d30) may also be very helpful.  This was confirmed to work in Windows 10 Home.

3. Follow the instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/openai/gym) to perform a minimal install of OpenAI gym.
	- Next, install the **classic control** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#classic-control).
	- Then, install the **box2d** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#box2d).

4. Clone the repository (if you haven't already!), and navigate to the `python/` folder.  Then, install several dependencies.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning.git
    cd deep-reinforcement-learning/python
    pip install .
    ```

5. Create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `drlnd` environment.
    ```bash
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name drlnd --display-name "drlnd"
    ```

6. Before running code in a notebook, change the kernel to match the `drlnd` environment by using the drop-down `Kernel` menu.
